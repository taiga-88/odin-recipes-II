        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Hawaiian fried rice is my version of what the locals ate in Hawaii. Everyone in Hawaii has their version of fried rice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons canola oil</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM), cubed</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced Chinese sweet pork sausage (lup cheong)</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped green onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Let rice cool completely.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir luncheon meat and sausage in hot oil until browned. Remove meat mixture to a plate. Pour beaten eggs into the same skillet; cook and stir until eggs are scrambled. Transfer eggs to the plate with meat mixture.</p>
        

        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir cooled rice in hot oil until heated through and beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add garlic powder; toss rice to develop garlic taste, about 1 minute. Stir in cooked meats, scrambled eggs, pineapple, and oyster sauce. Cook and stir until well combined and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in green onion to serve.</p>
